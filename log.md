# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work through the freeCodeCamp curriculum, today I practiced manipulating data structures including one- and two-dimensional arrays in JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** It was interesting and an important fundamental, tomorrow I will start the algorithm section.
